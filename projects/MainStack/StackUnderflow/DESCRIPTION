<b>StackUnderflow Project</b>
<p>
This is the EAGLE project for one of the robot's boards. This board:
<ul>
<li>carries and powers the FPGA and the Gumstix Overo
<li>provides an SPI link between the Gumstix Overo (master) and the FPGA (slave)
</ul>
<p>
The FPGA is connected to the board via two 2x32-pin connectors (Cardstac spec).
<p>
The Gumstix Overo is connected to the board via a Gumstix Pinto expansion board and two 30-pin connectors.
