This is the EAGLE project for one of the robot's boards. This board plugs on to the FPGA (Cardstac spec) and provides the following connectors:
<ul>
<li>1 connector for 4 quadrature encoders (via QuadEnc50)</li>
<li>1 connector for 8 analog sensors (via ADC33)</li>
<li>1 connector for 8 servos (via PWM50)</li>
<li>4 connectors for 2 motor controllers each</li>
<li>7 connectors with 8 IO lines each</li>
</ul>
<p>
As the board is plugged on an FPGA, even the dedicated connectors can be used for other tasks:
<ul>
<li>the quadrature encoders connector and the servos connector have 8 IO lines
<li>the analog sensors connector is an SPI port with only one slave select (although the 4 IO lines can be used for other tasks than SPI)
<li>only the motors connectors have a specific layout but still provide 6 IO lines
<ul>
