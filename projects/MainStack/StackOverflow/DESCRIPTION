This is the EAGLE project for one of the robot's boards. This board plugs on to the FPGA (Cardstac spec) and provides the following connectors:
<ul>
<li>2 connectors for 4 quadrature encoders each (via QuadEnc50)</li>
<li>4 connectors for 2 motor controllers each</li>
<li>2 connectors for 8 analog sensors each (via ADC33)</li>
<li>2 connectors for 8 servos each (via PWM50)</li>
<li>2 connectors with 8 GPIOs each</li>
<li>2 connectors with 7 GPIOs each</li>
</ul>
<p>
As the board is plugged on an FPGA, some of these connectors can of course be used for other tasks:
<ul>
<li>the quadrature encoders connectors, the servos connectors and the GPIO connectors all have 7 or 8 digital input/output lines
<li>the analog sensors connectors are nothing but SPI ports with only one slave select (although the 4 digital input/output lines can also be used for other tasks than SPI)
<li>only the motors connectors have a specific layout but still provide 6 digital input/output lines
<ul>
