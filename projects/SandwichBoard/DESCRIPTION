<b>SandwichBoard Project</b>
<p>
This is the EAGLE project for the robot's SandwichBoard. This board connects the Summit/Overo stack to the Quicgate FPGA via an SPI interface.
<p>
It also breakouts serial ports, I2C, PWM and ADC pins from the Overo.
<p>
The difficulty lies in the voltage level conversion. The Overo outputs are at 1.8V (2.5V for the ADC). They are translated to 3.3V for the SPI link with the FPGA, and 3.3V or 5V (configurable) for the serial ports, I2C and PWM pins. The ADC pins remain at 2.5V.
