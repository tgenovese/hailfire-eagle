<b>User Script Files</b>
<p>
Script files are a powerful tool. They can contain
long sequences of commands, such as the specification
of specific colors and fill-patterns for layers.
Since every EAGLE operation can be carried out with the
help of text commands, you can, for example, import data or
configure EAGLE with the aid of script files.
